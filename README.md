Sentiment analysis is a type of natural language processing that involves analyzing written or spoken language to determine the emotional tone of the text.
In the case of airlines, sentiment analysis can be used to analyze customer feedback, such as reviews, social media posts, and surveys, to determine the overall sentiment of customers towards the airline.
In this project we use sentiment analysis to analyze reviews for British Airways posted on airlinequality.com
first i had to collect the data by scraping the data from airlinequality.com using Beautiful Soup library.

Sentiment analysis helped to analyze customer feedback, airlines can identify the areas where they are falling short in terms of customer satisfaction. 
This can include issues such as delays, lost baggage, poor customer service, and uncomfortable seating. 
Once these issues are identified, airlines can take steps to address them, such as improving communication with customers, offering better compensation for delays, and upgrading their seating options.

Negative feedback can be damaging to an airline's reputation, and sentiment analysis can help airlines monitor and manage their online reputation. 
By tracking mentions of their brand on social media, review sites, and other platforms, airlines can quickly respond to negative feedback and address customer concerns before they escalate.
